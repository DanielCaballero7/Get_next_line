# Get_next_line

**get_next_line: A Line Reading Function for File Handling**


## Overview

"get_next_line" is a practical and efficient function that I developed to read lines from files or standard input, making it a valuable tool for handling input streams in C programs. This project showcases my ability to implement file I/O operations and manage dynamic memory allocation in a reliable and scalable manner.

## Description

"get_next_line" is a function that reads a single line from a file descriptor each time it is called. The function is designed to handle both newline-terminated lines and files without a newline at the end.

The implementation involves reading chunks of data from the file descriptor, dynamically managing memory to store the line read, and returning the line as a string. The function uses static variables to keep track of the file descriptor and the position within the file.

By calling "get_next_line" repeatedly, a C program can efficiently read and process large files or data streams, line by line, without loading the entire file into memory.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Line Reading**: "get_next_line" efficiently reads lines from a file descriptor without loading the entire file into memory.

- **Dynamic Memory Management**: The function allocates and manages dynamic memory as needed for reading and returning lines.

- **File Descriptor Independence**: The function allows reading from multiple file descriptors simultaneously without conflicts.

- **Robust Error Handling**: "get_next_line" includes thorough error handling to manage edge cases and ensure reliable performance.

## Outcome

Developing "get_next_line" has enhanced my understanding of file I/O operations and dynamic memory allocation in C. The project showcases my ability to implement efficient functions that are crucial for handling large datasets in real-world applications.

## Technologies Used

- C programming language

## Usage

To use "get_next_line" in your C projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Include the "get_next_line.h" header file in your C program.
3. Compile your C program along with the "get_next_line.c" source file.

## Note

"get_next_line" is a personal project developed for educational and demonstrative purposes. It is not intended for commercial use but can be freely utilized to streamline file handling in C programs.
